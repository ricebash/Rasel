reflect.n(i) = i - 2 proj.n(i)
1) the normal should face the ball/object
2) negate the normal if it doesn't
3) the normal of circle-circle is other.center-circle.center (dir is O to C)

need for the assumption that momentum is conserved.
1) we get the vector components of the velocity with respect to the collision axis (proj the collision axis to the velocity)
2) swap

s and t are the velocities other other and this, respectively

s' = proj.d(s)
where d = center - center (collision axis)

u = s' - s (some perpendicular line thingy)
u + s = s'

::swap s' with t'
s = (s-s') + t'
t = (t-t') + s'

s'= ( s * d ) * d
w is the distance of collision (the intersecting space)
w = c.r + o.r - | c - o |

check if w > 0 // we want it to be 0 or less to be not colliding



o += d * w/2 
c += -d * w/2
